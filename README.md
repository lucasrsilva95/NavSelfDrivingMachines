# NavSelfDrivingMachines
The main idea of this study was to develop an algorithm, using the Python language, that can be used to guide an agricultural machine through a road between plantations, so that the presence of a driver is not necessary to perform simple tasks, such as identifying pests in plantations, detecting plant growth problems and many other applications that require an agricultural machine to travel along a road in a plantation.

The algorithm uses image analysis tools, like image color segmentation, line detecting and line filtering. It was developed using the Python language and some computer vision libraries, such as OpenCV, Matplotlib and Numpy.

The final result of the algorithm implementation can be found in the video: https://youtu.be/mvXQG9z6MnE

The video presents several situations, like detecting the road limits of a narrow road, detecting the limits when the video presents several secondary roads, when the road has a curve, when only one of the road limits are visible in the video and many others.

The videos used in this project were recorded in a corn plantation, in several growth stages.
